## References
I used www schools for javascript issues.
I used jquery.com site for problems related to that techology.
I used all of the Google links that were related to font loading, critcal path
rendering, some of them Ilya's blogs.
I made extensive use of the Udacity forums when I got stuck.
I used Paul's site that showed the performance consequences of using different ccss methods.

#Summary of Steps
I worked through the PageSpeed insights scores.   I impemented the guidelines
from the course materials to minimize the critcial path.  This included -but
was not limtied to:
1. Inline CSS for rendering blocking css files.
2. Making use of the async keyword for rendering blocking javascript.
3. Loading the Google font asynchronously.
4. Employing media query to styles that weren't necessary like
css files related to the print media type.
5. Per PageInsights suggestion I decreased the size of the pizzeria
image to minimize the bytes in the critical path formula.
--Browser Performance
1.  In views/js/main.js I changed the loop limits to create only
enough pizzas that could be seen within the viewport.
2.  In the for loop in the update method I moved the computation
of phase out of the pizza object loop to only include the 5 possible
values and place those values in an array.
3.  I optimized the pizza resizing by limiting unnecessary DOM
queries by placing the query outside of the loop and using
the array results to change the size within the loop for each
array item returned from the query.


HOW TO RUN INSTRUCTIONS
After placing the site contents in a suitable folder, you can view the site by using
a web browser to view the index.htm from the root directory.  Alternatively,
I have replicated this project into my github page. You can use the URL http://kwendell.github.io
to access the page(s).

## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js.

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
